## Acknowledgements

The knob is our first try at building physical device. Although this is very different, the initial inspiration came from the [Smartknob](https://youtu.be/ip641WmY4pA?si=oMXHZ1xV06TqFzg1). This project served as a relativally simple test to get our feet wet in the world of 3D printing and electronics.
