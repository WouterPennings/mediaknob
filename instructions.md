# Instructions

Here you will find component list, schematics and instructions to build the media knob.

## Components

- Arduino Pro Micro 5V ([Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640))
  - Make sure you buy a Pro Micro with identical dimentions as the Sparkfun one
- EC11 Rotary encoder ([Aliexpress](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005002802225957.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.73.1a476867OZREEx&algo_pvid=b6bf1163-fa66-4662-8d6a-866a64e69d97&algo_exp_id=b6bf1163-fa66-4662-8d6a-866a64e69d97-36&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21EUR%210.63%210.51%21%21%210.67%21%21%40211b617a16933239714535859e7a21%2112000022266485904%21sea%21NL%210%21A&curPageLogUid=IVOv2xvNuyEq))
- All 3D printed parts, STL files can be found in [3d](/3d)
- Some electrical wire or 5 jumper wires
- Micro USB cable

## Electrical Schematic

The pins in this schematic are connected to `D8` through `D10`. However, you could use any digitalpin or analogpin for that matter in this build, as we will not be doing anything more than digitalreads from the pins.

**The Arduino Pro Micro found in this image has different dimentions compared to the one recommended above. THIS ONE WILL NOT FIT IN THE 3D PRINT, make sure you buy the correct version.*
